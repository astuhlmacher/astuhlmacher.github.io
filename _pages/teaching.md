### EE 4800/5900: Distributed Energy Resources
  * Spring 2025
  * Course Summary: Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) are becoming increasingly more common in power distribution systems. DERs are controllable, small-scale resources such as renewable energy generation, energy storage, and flexible loads. This course presents an overview of DERs and their integration into the electric power grid. Topics covered include the technological and policy aspects associated with DER integration as well as interconnection challenges and solutions. 


### EE 3120: Electrical Energy Systems
  * Fall 2023, Fall 2024
  * Course Summary: An overview of the generation and utilization of electrical energy. Covers three-phase circuits, transformers, photovoltaics, batteries, electromechanical energy conversion, and an overview of electric power systems, including economic issues.  

### EE 5232: Power System Optimization
  * Spring 2024
  * Course Summary: An overview of electric power system markets and optimization methods used to solve planning and operational problems. Covers fundamentals of power system economics, organization of electricity markets, and common power system optimization formulations, including optimal power flow, economic dispatch, and unit commitment. Recent advances in convex relaxations and approximations of the optimal power flow problem will be highlighted. Current challenges and issues of actual electricity markets will be discussed, such as the integration of renewable energy resources and demand response into markets.



## University of Michigan

### EECS 534: Analysis of Electric Power Distribution Grids and Loads
  * Fall 2022, Guest Lecturer
  * Course Summary: This course covers the fundamentals of electric power system markets and the optimization methods required to solve planning and operational problems including economic dispatch, optimal power flow, and unit commitment. The course will highlight recent advances including convex relaxations of the optimal power flow problem, and formulations/solutions to stochastic dispatch problems. Problems will be placed in the context of actual electricity markets, and new issues, such as incorporation of renewable resources and demand response into markets, will be covered.


### EECS 460: Control Systems Analysis and Design
   * Fall 2021, Graduate Student Instructor
   * Course Summary: This course will provide working knowledge of basic techniques used for analysis and design of controllers applicable in any industry (e.g. automotive, aerospace, computer, communication, chemical, bioengineering, power, etc.). Both time- and frequency-domain methods for analysis and design of feedback control systems will be covered. Root locus, Nyquist and Bode plot-based techniques will be outlined. Computational tools like MATLAB and/or Simulink will be used throughout the course particularly in homework.
