## Michigan Tech

### EE 3120: Electrical Energy Systems
  * Fall 2023
  * Course Summary: An overview of the generation and utilization of electrical energy. Covers three-phase circuits, transformers, photovoltaics, batteries, electromechanical energy conversion, and an overview of electric power systems, including economic issues.

## University of Michigan

### EECS 534: Analysis of Electric Power Distribution Grids and Loads
  * Fall 2022, Guest Lecturer
  * Course Summary: This course covers the fundamentals of electric power system markets and the optimization methods required to solve planning and operational problems including economic dispatch, optimal power flow, and unit commitment. The course will highlight recent advances including convex relaxations of the optimal power flow problem, and formulations/solutions to stochastic dispatch problems. Problems will be placed in the context of actual electricity markets, and new issues, such as incorporation of renewable resources and demand response into markets, will be covered.


### EECS 460: Control Systems Analysis and Design
   * Fall 2021, Graduate Student Instructor
   * Course Summary: This course will provide working knowledge of basic techniques used for analysis and design of controllers applicable in any industry (e.g. automotive, aerospace, computer, communication, chemical, bioengineering, power, etc.). Both time- and frequency-domain methods for analysis and design of feedback control systems will be covered. Root locus, Nyquist and Bode plot-based techniques will be outlined. Computational tools like MATLAB and/or Simulink will be used throughout the course particularly in homework.
