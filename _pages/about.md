I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at <a href="https://www.mtu.edu/ece/" target="_blank">Michigan Technological University</a>. 
Prior to joining Michigan Tech, I received my Ph.D. and M.S. degrees in Electrical Engineering at the <a href="https://eecs.engin.umich.edu/" target="_blank">University of Michigan</a> and my bachelors degree in Electrical Engineering at <a href="https://www.bu.edu/eng/academics/departments-and-divisions/electrical-and-computer-engineering/" target="_blank">Boston University</a>. I have also interned at the  <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/" target="_blank">National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)</a>.

## Research Interests
* Power Systems
* Distributed Energy Resources and Demand Response
* Optimization
* Critical Infrastructure Systems
* Agrivoltaics

My research explores the optimization of uncertain distributed energy resources (DERs) and the coordination of the power grid with other infrastructure systems and sectors. DERs—such as distributed generation, storage, and flexible loads—can be optimized and controlled to provide flexibility within the electric power grid. I am particularly interested in modeling and optimizing the inherent flexibility and uncertainty propagation between power systems and other infrastructure systems, such as drinking water, wastewater treatment, and agricultural systems. 

## Looking for undergraduate research experience?
If you are a current undergraduate student at Michigan Tech interested in getting involved in research, please reach out! 

## Prospective Graduate Students
I am not currently looking for Ph.D. students to join my research group for the 25-26 academic year. I will update my page when this changes.

## About Michigan Tech
Michigan Tech is located in Houghton, Michigan. Houghton is a small town in the upper peninsula of Michigan with year-round outdoor recreation opportunities. Michigan Tech has a longstanding power systems program, with strong connections to utility companies and industry. A wide range of power system courses are available.
