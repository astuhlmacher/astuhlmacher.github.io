I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at <a href="https://www.mtu.edu/ece/" target="_blank">Michigan Technological University</a>. 
Prior to joining Michigan Tech, I received my Ph.D. and M.S. degrees in Electrical Engineering at the <a href="https://eecs.engin.umich.edu/" target="_blank">University of Michigan</a> and my bachelors degree in Electrical Engineering at <a href="https://www.bu.edu/eng/academics/departments-and-divisions/electrical-and-computer-engineering/" target="_blank">Boston University</a>. I have also interned at the  <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/" target="_blank">National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)</a>.

## Research Interests

* Power Systems
* Distributed Energy Resources
* Optimization
* Critical Infrastructure Systems

My research explores optimizing and controlling distributed energy resources in power systems to provide flexibility. Flexibility is important in the transition to sustainable energy systems. I am advancing this work by developing uncertainty-aware optimization frameworks, integrating network resiliency and tractable, distributed algorithms into operational planning, and emphasizing energy justice goals. I am particularly interested in modeling and optimizing the inherent flexibility and uncertainty propagation between power systems and other infrastructure systems, such as drinking water and agricultural systems.


## Prospective Students
I am looking for PhD students to join my research group who are passionate about power systems and integrating distributed energy resources (such as distributed generation, storage, and flexible loads) into the grid. If you are interested in working with me, please send me an email to annastu at mtu.edu with the subject line 'Prospective PhD Student'. In the email, include your CV and describe your research interests and previous experience. [Click here for more information.](/files/Stuhlmacher-ResearchFlyer.pdf)
