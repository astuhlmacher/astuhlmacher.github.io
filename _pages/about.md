I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at <a href="https://www.mtu.edu/ece/" target="_blank">Michigan Technological University</a>. 
Prior to joining Michigan Tech, I received my Ph.D. and M.S. degrees in Electrical Engineering at the <a href="https://eecs.engin.umich.edu/" target="_blank">University of Michigan</a> and my bachelors degree in Electrical Engineering at <a href="https://www.bu.edu/eng/academics/departments-and-divisions/electrical-and-computer-engineering/" target="_blank">Boston University</a>. I have also interned at the  <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/" target="_blank">National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)</a>.

## Research Interests

* Power Systems
* Distributed Energy Resources
* Optimization
* Critical Infrastructure Systems

My research explores optimizing and controlling distributed energy resources in power systems to provide flexibility. Flexibility is important in the transition to sustainable energy systems. I am advancing this work by developing uncertainty-aware optimization frameworks, integrating network resiliency and tractable, distributed algorithms into operational planning, and emphasizing energy justice goals. I am particularly interested in modeling and optimizing the inherent flexibility and uncertainty propagation between power systems and other infrastructure systems, such as drinking water and agricultural systems.

## Looking for research experience?
If you are a current undergraduate or graduate student at Michigan Tech interested in getting involved in research, please reach out! 

## Prospective Graduate Students
I am not currently looking for Ph.D. students to join my research group for the 24-25 academic year. I will update my page when this changes.
