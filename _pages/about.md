    </p>


I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at <a href="https://www.mtu.edu/ece/" target="_blank">Michigan Technological University</a>. 
Prior to joining Michigan Tech, I received my Ph.D. and M.S. degrees in Electrical Engineering at the <a href="https://eecs.engin.umich.edu/" target="_blank">University of Michigan</a> and my bachelors degree in Electrical Engineering at <a href="https://www.bu.edu/eng/academics/departments-and-divisions/electrical-and-computer-engineering/" target="_blank">Boston University</a>. I have also interned at the  <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/" target="_blank">National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)</a>.

## Research Interests
* Power Systems
* Distributed Energy Resources and Demand Response
* Optimization
* Critical Infrastructure Systems
* Agrivoltaics

My research explores optimizing and controlling distributed energy resources in power systems to provide flexibility. Flexibility is important in the transition to sustainable energy systems. I am advancing this work by developing uncertainty-aware optimization frameworks, integrating network resiliency and tractable, distributed algorithms into operational planning, and emphasizing energy justice goals. I am particularly interested in modeling and optimizing the inherent flexibility and uncertainty propagation between power systems and other infrastructure systems, such as drinking water and agricultural systems.

## Looking for undergraduate research experience?
If you are a current undergraduate student at Michigan Tech interested in getting involved in research, please reach out! 

## Prospective Graduate Students
I am looking for PhD students to join my research group who are interested in the power grid with strong math and coding (e.g., Julia, Python, and/or Matlab) backgrounds. If you are interested in working with me, please send an email to annastu at mtu.edu with the subject line 'Prospective PhD Student'. In the email, include your CV and describe your research interests and previous experience.

## About Michigan Tech
Michigan Tech is located in Houghton, Michigan. Houghton is a small town in the upper peninsula of Michigan with year-round outdoor recreation opportunities. Michigan Tech has a longstanding power systems program, with strong connections to utility companies and industry. A wide range of power system courses are available.
